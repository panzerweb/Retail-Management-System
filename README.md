### **About the Developer**

Hi! I am Romeo Selwyn M. Villar, I am a first-year student in Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at Davao del Norte State College (DNSC).

I am interested in Web Development, Graphic Design, and Software Development. I have created simple, and imaginable projects recently.

The idea of this project from a classmate of mine who discussed me upon this concept of recording all transactions in their sari-sari store. Likewise, I also have a sari-sari store and was fascinated by the idea so I started creating the system.
